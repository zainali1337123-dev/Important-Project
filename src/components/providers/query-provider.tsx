/**
 * React Query provider — wraps the entire app.
 *
 * Why: enables client-side data caching with smart invalidation.
 * - Page navigation back/forward: instant (data already in memory)
 * - Tab switching: instant
 * - Background refetch keeps data fresh (staleTime controls this)
 *
 * Safety:
 * - If React Query fails for any reason, useQuery falls back to its own retry logic.
 * - Hooks built on top (src/hooks/queries.ts) wrap useQuery with conservative defaults.
